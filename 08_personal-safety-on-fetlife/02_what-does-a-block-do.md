# What does a block do?

When you block a member, they won't be able to see any part of your profile. John has been trying to make this feature for mother-in-laws but no luck so far :-)

Blocking someone, or getting blocked by another member also means the following between you two:

- Unable to view each other's profile
- Unable to find each other through search
- Archives all private messages
- Deletes all wall posts
- Removes friendship and/or following status
- Removes any relationship statuses
- Hides loves on all content on FetLife by each other
- Hides comments on all status updates on FetLife by each other
- Hides all comments with @ mentions targeting the blocked member on status updates

Please note that blocks won't prevent the blocked member from seeing your:

- Comments and attendance in groups
- Comments on other people's walls, pictures, writings and videos
- RSVPs to events

---

If the blocked person makes an alternate profile to contact you around that block, that's called a "sock puppet". Notify the FetLife Caretakers, and they'll investigate. If discovered, the sock puppet is deleted and the member warned.
