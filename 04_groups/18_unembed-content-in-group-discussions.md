# How do I unembed YouTube videos in group posts?

Embedding YouTube videos is fun! However, some group owners have asked us "What do we do if we don't approve of the embedded content?". Put simply - unembed the video. This leaves the link and the discussion in place, but removes the embedded content from the group post.

All you have to do is add [square brackets] around the link. For example:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "")........ - puts in an embedded video

[[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "")].... - takes out the embedding
