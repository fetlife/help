# How do I change the privacy of my Writings?

There are 2 different privacy settings for Writings:

- FetLifers (Everyone on FetLife can read the writing.)
- Just Friends

You can change the privacy of a writing at any time by:

1. Opening the Writing
2. Selecting the menu in the upper right corner (which looks like three dots)
3. Selecting "Edit"
4. Selecting "Privacy" and then your preferred setting
5. Submitting the form to save the changes

_Note: You can also choose to turn off the ability for other people to comment on your writing by selecting 'close comments' from the three dots menu._
