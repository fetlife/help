# How do I change the privacy settings on my Writings?

You can change your privacy settings to 'Friends Only' or 'Kinksters' (everyone on Fetlife) at any time by:

1. Opening the Writing that you want to change
2. Selecting the menu in the upper right corner (which looks like three dots)
3. Selecting "Edit"
4. Selecting "Privacy" and then your preferred setting
5. Submitting the form to save the changes
