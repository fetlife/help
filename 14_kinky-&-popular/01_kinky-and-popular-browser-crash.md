# Kinky & Popular crashed my browser!  What's up with that?

Odds are, you've got an older computer - usually using an older browser - and it just can't take all the luscious, delectable, kinky.... oh wait, you crashed, that wasn't nice.

Seriously, loading up to 5,000 different items on your computer can overload some older systems. There are a couple ways you can try to improve the situation:

1. Figure out how much your computer can handle - and don't go further down the screen than that.
2. Try updating your browser to the newest version or using a different browser. We recommend [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) or [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari).

*note: Updating to the latest browser is very important if you want to stay safe on the internet. You may not realize it, but out of date browsers can be hacked by simply going to a single malicious link! Keep yourself and your info safe - update your browser today! :-)*
