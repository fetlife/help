# Create and host Virtual Events

Virtual Events are very similar to in-person events, the only difference is that they are location independent and hosted online. These events can be anything: meetups, munches, shows, conferences, livestreams, etc.


#### How do I create one?

Quite similar to regular in-person events, you can create a virtual event the following way:

1. Head over to the [event section](https://fetlife.com/events/near)
2. Press [Create New Event](https://fetlife.com/events/new)
3. Fill in your event details
4. Make sure to select "Virtual" in the "Type" input
5. Publish your event by pressing the "Create New Event" button
6. Find your new virtual event in the [virtual events tab](https://fetlife.com/events/virtual)
7. Spread the word!


#### How do I host a virtual event?

We recommend preparing for this by:

- Coming up with a plan of what you wish to do during the virtual event
- Testing your setup prior to the event, ideally with a few people
- Sharing the link a while before the event starts, this gives people time to connect and sort out technical issues
- Expect technical issues, make sure you have a plan B
- Make sure you can reach your event RSVPs in case of issues
