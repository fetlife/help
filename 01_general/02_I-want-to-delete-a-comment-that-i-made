Currently, you can't delete a comment you made on someone else’s Picture, Video, Writing, Status Update, or Wall - but they can! We suggest you contact the person who owns the profile that you commented on and ask them to remove your comment. 

If it’s a comment you made in a group, you will need to contact the group owner or moderators to see if they will delete it for you.
