# How do I delete a comment that I made?

You can delete comments you made on another member's content at anytime by:

1. Selecting the "more" drop-down menu underneath your comment
2. Choosing "Delete"

If itâ€™s a comment you made in a group, you will need to contact the group owner or moderators and ask if they will delete it for you.
