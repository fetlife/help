# How do I delete a comment that I made?

Currently, you can't delete a comment you made on another member’s Picture, Video, Writing, Status Update, or Wall - but they can! We suggest you contact them and ask if they will delete it for you. 

If it’s a comment you made in a group, you will need to contact the group owner or moderators and ask if they will delete it for you.
