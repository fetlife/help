# Why would I want to love stuff?

When you select the 'love' button on something it does a few different things:

1. Your friends and followers will see it in their feeds so it's a perfect way to share awesome things with them!
2. It acts as a way of bookmarking your favourite pictures, videos, and writings. You can see all of your loved content in the [Stuff You Love](https://fetlife.com/explore/stuff-you-love/) page.
3. Having tons of people love something within a short period of time is the only way for it to get on [Kinky & Popular](https://fetlife.com/explore/) - so if you want something to get on K&P, you are voting for it with your love!
