# Why would I want to love stuff?

When you click on the "love" button, it does a few different things.

When you love something, your friends will see it on their feeds, so this is a way to share stuff with them.

Loving also acts as a way of bookmarking your favorite pictures, videos, and Writings. You can see all the stuff you loved on the ["Stuff You Love"](https://fetlife.com/explore/stuff-you-love/#/) page.  (Go to the Explore page and select the "Stuff You Love" tab).

Finally, having tons of people love something in a short time period is the only way for it to get on Kinky & Popular. So if you want to see something on K&P, you are voting for it with your love!
