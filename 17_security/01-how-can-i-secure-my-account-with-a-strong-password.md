# How can I secure my account with a strong password?

The following guidelines are essential for having a safe browsing experience across all password protected sites you use.  We highly recommend doing all of the below:

1. Choose unique passwords for each site that require a password
2. Use a password manager to keep track of your passwords (for example: [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/). These password managers will also automatically tell you if a site has been compromised so that you can change your password on that site!
3. Keep your passwords private and share them with no one, **not even your partner!**
4. When creating a password, use a [password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to help you
5. When creating a password:
-  Avoid common words and character combinations
- The longer the password, the better! A minimum of 8 characters is a good start
- Use a combination of letters (both capitalized and lowercase), numbers, and symbols
6. If you didn’t choose a password manager, check whether your previous passwords have been compromised on other sites by using [Have I Been Pwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)

Even when you manage your passwords well, there’s still a small chance of them being compromised. So, think about people with access to your devices, for example. So we recommend securing your account even more by setting up [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](link to 2FA article).
