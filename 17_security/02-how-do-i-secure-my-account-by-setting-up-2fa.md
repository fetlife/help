# How do I secure my account by setting up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

Having a [strong password](link to password article) is the first line of defence to keeping your account safe. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an additional layer of security that protects your account even more. We highly recommend all our members to use 2FA to keep your account and its contents safe!

In order to enable 2FA, please download and install an authentication application to your phone.  Examples of these applications are [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [Google Authenticator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+authenticator+app).  There are other applications, but these two are the most common.

You can turn on 2FA at any time by:
1. Visiting your settings page
2. Selecting “Enable” next to 2FA
3. Entering your password on the next screen
4. Using your authentication app to scan the QR code
5. Entering the verification code you receive from your authentication app to activate 2FA

**Note**: After 2FA is enabled, you will be prompted to download a list of recovery codes.  Please keep those codes safe because they can help you log in if something happens to the device you used to enable 2FA.

Alternatively, you can enable 2FA here https://fetlife.com/settings/account/2fa/enable/password
