# How do I secure my account with a strong password?

The following guidelines are essential for having a safe browsing experience across all password protected sites you use. We highly recommend doing all of the below:

1. Choose unique passwords for each site that require a password
2. Use a password manager to keep track of your passwords (for example: [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)). These password managers will also automatically tell you if a site has been compromised so that you can change your password on that site!
3. Keep your passwords private and share them with no one, **not even your partner!**
4. When creating a password, use a [password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to help you and:
  - Avoid common words and character combinations
  - The longer the password, the better! A minimum of 8 characters is a good start
  - Use a combination of letters (both capitalized and lowercase), numbers, and symbols

Even when you manage your passwords well, thereâ€™s still a small chance of them being compromised (e.g. people with access to your devices). So we recommend securing your account even more by setting up [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](link to 2FA article).
