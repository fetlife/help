# How do I change my email address?

So you want all your FetLife email to be going to a particular email address that is different than the one you signed up on, huh? No worries!

You can change your email address [here](https://fetlife.com/settings/account/email).

Alternatively, follow these steps to update your email address.
1. Click on the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. Select “Update Settings" in the dropdown menu.
3. Click "Update" next to your email address under the Account tab. Your current email address is already filled in.
4. Input your new email address plus your current password.
5. Click on the red “Update Email” button.

Easy as cake!
