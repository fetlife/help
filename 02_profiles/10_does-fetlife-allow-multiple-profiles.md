# Does FetLife allow multiple profiles?

Yes, FetLife allows members to have multiple profiles - as long as these profiles are genuine and their pictures are **_OF_** or **_BY_** them.

There are some types of alternate profiles that we do not allow. For example:
- Sock Puppets - alternate or secondary profiles that are used to go around blocks, bans, and profile restrictions, or to spoof or maliciously attack other members of FetLife
- Impostors - someone who is posing as another person

If you're ready to make another profile and need help, visit "[How do I make a secondary profile?](https://fetlife.com/help/how-do-i-make-a-secondary-profile)".
