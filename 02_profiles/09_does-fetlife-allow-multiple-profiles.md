# Does FetLife allow multiple profiles?

Yes, FetLife allows members to have multiple profiles. 

For example, MeanUberDom might have a secret fantasy about being spanked and doesn't feel comfortable letting all their friends know - so they creates a secondary (also called an alternate) profile called PlsSpankMeMommy to explore this other side of their sexuality. 

Their pictures must still be *_OF_* or *_BY_* them but they donâ€™t need to be as identifiable. The information about age and such may be changed to help them feel comfortable and not judged by others. This is one type of secondary profile allowed on FetLife.

There are some types of alternate profiles that we do not allow. For example:
- Sock Puppets - alternate or secondary profiles that are used to go around blocks, bans, other profile restrictions, or spoof or maliciously attack other members of FetLife. When reported and verified, we wash those socks right out of FetLife!
- Other profile restrictions could include, but are not limited to, using alternate profiles to
     - Surpass the 20 group limit ownership rule
     - Circumvent our automatic spam restrictions
     - Bypass a sitewide time out
- Impostors - someone who is posing as another person.
