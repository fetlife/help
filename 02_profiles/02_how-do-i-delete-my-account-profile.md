# How do I delete my account/profile?

You can delete your profile [here](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete). 

Alternatively, follow these steps to delete or deactivate your profile:
1. Click on the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. Click on “Update Settings" in the dropdown menu.
3. On the right side of the page, you'll see a "Deactivate/Delete Account” section.
4. Click on “Deactivate or Delete my Account” and select “Delete” from the dropdown box that appears.
5. Finally, enter your password and confirm by hitting the button below and your profile will be put into the delete queue.

When you set your profile for deletion, it becomes inactive and is put into the queue to be deleted in seven days. Change your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next seven days. Your profile will become active and move out of the delete queue!

Just remember, we will always be here for you! Don't hesitate to rejoin in the future.
