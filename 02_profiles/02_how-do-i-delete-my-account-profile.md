# How do I delete my account/profile?

You can delete your profile [here](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete). 

Alternatively, follow these steps to delete or deactivate your profile:
1. Select the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife"s navigation bar.
2. Select “Update Settings" in the dropdown menu.
3. On the right side of the page, you'll see a "Deactivate/Delete Account” section.
4. Select “Deactivate or Delete my Account”.
5. Select “Delete” from the dropdown box that appears.
6. Finally, enter your password and submit the form. Your profile will then be put into the delete queue.

When you set your profile for deletion, it becomes hidden and is put into the queue to be deleted in seven days. Changed your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next seven days. Your profile will become active again.

Note: Deleting your profile is permanent.  Once the seven-day grace period has passed, there is no way to retrieve a profile.

Just remember, we will always be here for you! Don't hesitate to rejoin in the future.
