# How do I make a secondary profile?

Simple! You make it the same way you made your first profile. If you're already logged in to a profile, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. Click on the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. Click on "Logout" in the dropdown menu.
3. Click "Join FetLife.‚Äù

Please note that for each profile you create, FetLife requires a unique:
- Email address
- Nickname
- Phone number (if using SMS verification) or
- Email invitation from a past or current FetLife Supporter
