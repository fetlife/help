# I can't find my location in the list, what do I do?

Currently, our list of locations isn't complete and missing some cities. We realize this is annoying and that we need to fix it!

However, we cannot fix the problem without overhauling the whole thing. So in the meantime, if your location is not listed, please pick the closest city to you until we can implement an updated list of locations.

Sorry for the inconvenience! :-(
