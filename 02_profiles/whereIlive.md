### I don't want everyone to know where I live. What do I do?

We recommend you choose a location that is in your general area, but not specific to your current location.

If you really want to be off the radar, you can always just specify your country as "Antarctica.” There are more kinksters than you would think of living in Antarctica. Apparently, with all this leather around and not a cow in sight, the penguins are getting very nervous!!

You can update your location [here](https://fetlife.com/settings/profile).

Alternatively, follow these steps to update your location:
1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife"s navigation bar.
2. Click on “Edit Profile" in the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down to the Location section. 
4. Use the drop-down menus to select the place you want and click "Update Profile".
