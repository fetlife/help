# How do I delete my account/profile?

You can delete your account at any time by:

1. Visiting https://fetlife.com/settings/account
2. Selecting "Deactivate or Delete my Account" on the right side of the page
3. Selecting "Delete" from the drop-down box, filling in your password, and submitting the form

Alternatively, you can go directly to the form here: https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete

When you set your profile to delete, it is deactivated and put into the queue to be deleted in seven days. Change your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days. Your profile will activate and move out of the delete queue!

Just remember, we will always be here for you. Don't hesitate to re-join in the future.
