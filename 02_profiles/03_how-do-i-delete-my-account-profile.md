# How do I delete my account/profile?

You can delete your account at any time by going to the delete or deactivate my profile section in your account settings [here.](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete)

When you set your profile to delete, it is removed from the website and put into our deletion queue for all of your data to be completely deleted in seven days. 

Changed your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days. You will be asked if you wish to reactivate and once you do your account will move out of the delete queue and be fully restored!

Just remember, we will always be here for you <3. Don't hesitate to re-join us again in the future!
