# How do I delete my account/profile?

1. Visiting https://fetlife.com/settings/account
2. Selecting “delete or deactivate my account” on the right
3. Filling out and submitting the form

Alternatively, you can fill out the form [here.](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete)

When you set your profile to delete, it is removed from the website and put into our deletion queue for all of your data to be completely deleted in seven days. 

Changed your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days. You will be asked if you wish to reactivate and once you do your account will move out of the delete queue and be fully restored!

Just remember, we will always be here for you <3. Don't hesitate to re-join us again in the future!
