# How do I delete my account/profile?

You can delete your account/profile at any time by:

1. Visiting https://fetlife.com/settings/account
2. Selecting “Deactivate or Delete my Account” on the right side of the page
3. Filling out and submitting the form

When you set your profile to delete, it is removed from the site and put into our delete queue. All of your data will be deleted in seven days.
