# How do I delete my profile?

You can delete your profile at any time by:

1. Visiting https://fetlife.com/settings/account
2. Selecting “Deactivate or Delete my Account”
3. Confirming you want to delete your account

Alternatively, you can go directly to the form here: https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=permanently%20delete 

When you chose to delete your profile it will be put in the deletion queue. All of your data will be permanently deleted after 7 days.

_Note: Changed your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days. You will be asked if you wish to reactivate and once you do your account will move out of the delete queue and be fully restored._
