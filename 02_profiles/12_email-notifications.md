# Email Notifications

You can update your email notification settings in one of two ways.

1. By going to your global email notifications settings tab in your account settings [here](https://fetlife.com/settings/notifications). 
2. By using the checkbox on the discussions tab of a FetLife Group to select whether or not you get email notifications from that particular group.

Note: It can sometimes take up to 24 hours for changes to email notifications to take effect.
