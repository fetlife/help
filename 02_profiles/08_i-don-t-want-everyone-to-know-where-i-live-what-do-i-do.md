# I don't want everyone to know where I live, what do I do?

We recommend you choose a location that is in your general area, but not specific to your current location.

If you really want to be off the radar, you can always just specify your country as "Antarctica”. There are more kinksters living in Antarctica than you'd think!

To update your location, follow these steps:
1. Select the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife"s navigation bar.
2. Select “Edit Profile" in the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down to the Location section. Use the drop-down menus to select the place you want and select "Update Profile."

Alternatively, you can update your location [here](https://fetlife.com/settings/profile).
