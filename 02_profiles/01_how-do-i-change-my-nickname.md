# How do I change my nickname?

First, check to see if anyone on the site is already using the nickname you want. 

A quick way to do this is to add the username that you are interested in to the end of 'Fetlife.com/' in your URL bar.  For example, JohnBaku's URL looks like this - https://fetlife.com/users/johnbaku.  If you see a 404 error, the nickname you want is available. :-)

Follow these steps to change your nickname:
1. Select the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. Select â€œUpdate Settings" in the dropdown menu.
3. Select "Change" next to your nickname under the Account tab.

Alternatively, here's a [quick link:](https://fetlife.com/settings/account/nickname).

_Note: You can change your own nickname once every 28 days._
