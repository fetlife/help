# How do I change my nickname?

First, check to see if anyone on the site is already using the nickname you want. 

A quick way to do this is to type http://fetlife.com/username_YOU_want in the URL bar. If you are taken back to your activity feed, the nickname you want is available. :-)

To update your nickname:
Here's a quick link: https://fetlife.com/settings/account/nickname.
An alternate method is:
Click on the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right-hand corner of the page.
Click on “Update Settings" in the dropdown menu.
Click "Change" next to your nickname under the Account tab.

Note: You can change your own nickname once every 28 days.
