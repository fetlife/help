# Can other members see my profile while my account is deactivated?

No, other members can’t see your profile while your account is deactivated.

Specifically, while an account is deactivated, other members:
- Cannot see the profile, including but not limited to:
     - Main profile page
     - Pictures, Videos, or Writings 
     - Past activity
     - Friends, Followers, or Following lists
- Cannot start a new private message with a deactivated profile
- Cannot see any of your activity on their main feed
- Cannot find you in search results


While other members cannot see a deactivated profile, if you deactivate your profile, they can still see:
- Groups that you own or moderate
- Events you've created
- Private messages you've sent to them (but they won’t be able to respond)
- You will still be seen in:
     - Groups you are currently a member of
     - An active member’s list of friends, followers, and following.
     - Comments you've made in groups, on other member’s Pictures, Videos, Writings, and other member’s Status Updates.
