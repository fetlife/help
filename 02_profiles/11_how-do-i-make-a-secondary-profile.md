# How do I make a secondary profile?

Simple! You just make it in the same way that you made your first profile. If you're already logged in to a profile, you'll need to [log out first](https://fetlife.com/logged_out)

For each profile you create you will need a unique:
- Email address
- Nickname
- Phone number (if using SMS verification)

Alternatively you can have an [email invitation](https://fetlife.com/invite) sent from anyone who is (or has been) a FetLife Supporter.
