# How do I secure my account even more by setting up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

Your profile name or email address plus a password is the first layer of protection for your profile.  2FA is an extra layer of security that protects your account from unauthorized access by requiring two different authentication types. FetLife offers this additional security to our members. 

Before you enable 2FA, please download and install an authentication application to your phone.  Examples of these applications are [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [Google Authenticator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+authenticator+app).  There are other applications, but these two are the most common.

 **Important**: You risk locking yourself out of your profile if you do not download an authentication app before continuing with the next steps.

You can turn on 2FA at any time by:
Visiting your settings page
Selecting “Enable” next to 2FA
Entering your password on the next screen
Using your authentication app to scan the QR code
Entering the verification code you receive from your authentication app to activate 2FA

Note: After 2FA is enabled, you will be prompted to download a list of recovery codes.  Please keep those codes safe because they can help you log in if something happens to the device you used to enable 2FA.

Alternatively, you can enable 2FA here https://fetlife.com/settings/account/2fa/enable/password
