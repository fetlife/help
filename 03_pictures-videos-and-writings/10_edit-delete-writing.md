# How do I edit or delete my Writing?

How do I edit or delete my Writings?
Go to your Writing. Select the three dots menu located at the top right of the Writing.
 
Select “Edit” to:

- Edit your writing itself
- Change the title
- Add or remove tags
- Change the writing’s privacy settings

Note: If you want to add extra features to your Writings, such as underlines, bold, different sized fonts, etc., check out our [formatting guidelines](https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines).

Select “Close Comments” to remove the option for people to comment on that Writing. Reopening comments can be selected from the same menu when you’re ready to turn them back on! You can also do this by selecting your Writing from your Activity Feed.

Select “Delete” to delete your Writing.
