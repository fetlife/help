# How do I upload a picture to my profile?

1. Find an Upload link. There are three places to find an Upload link.
- Click on the hamburger menu (the icon with three horizontal lines) at the top right corner of the page and then on “Upload Picture.” 
- At the top of the activity feed page, in the “Status Update” box, there are options to upload Pictures, Videos, and Writings.
- At the top of your Picture gallery page, there is an option to upload a picture.

2. Select  "Choose File”. 
Find the content on your computer that you want to upload, select it, and submit it! 

3. You will see the settings for your new picture.  
General Settings
- In the top section, you’ll see a thumbnail of your content.  
- You can enter a caption in the second section.  
- The third section is for tags.  You may select a tag when you upload your content.  Tags help describe your content and increases its visibility if you are sharing with more than ‘Just Friends.’  

Checkboxes
- There is a checkbox that will let you make the picture your main avatar.  
- There is the publishing rights checkbox where you affirm to us that you own the content, you’ve created the content, or that you have someone else’s explicit written permission to post the content.

Privacy Options
This is the section where you can choose to let your picture be seen by all members of FetLife (FetLifers) or you can set it to Friends only.

4.  Submit the picture!
Once you have chosen your options, select "Upload Picture" and wait for the magic to happen!  After a moment you'll be redirected to your newly uploaded picture page. Purty, innit?
