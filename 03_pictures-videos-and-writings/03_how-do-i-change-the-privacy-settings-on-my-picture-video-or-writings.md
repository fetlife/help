# How do I change the privacy settings on my picture, video or writings? 

You can change privacy options on a picture or video at anytime by:

1. Visiting the "Options" menu link located beneath the caption of the picture or video that you want to change
2. Selecting “Edit” to change your privacy settings
3. Selecting “Close Comments” to remove the option for people to comment on that picture or video (you can reopen comments in the same way)
