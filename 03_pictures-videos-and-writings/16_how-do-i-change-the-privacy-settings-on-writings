# How do I change the privacy settings on one of my Writings?

When you create a Writing on FetLife the default privacy setting is set to ‘FetLifers’ - meaning everyone on FetLife will be able to view it!

You can change this before you post your Writing by selecting the ‘Friends-Only’ option from the drop down menu at the bottom of the new Writing box. 

To change the privacy settings on a Writing after you have published it, simply go to the Writing you wish to change, select the three dots menu at the top right of the Writing then select edit. A box will appear with a drop-down menu.  The bottom option is labeled "Privacy." Select the option you prefer and submit it to update your writing!
