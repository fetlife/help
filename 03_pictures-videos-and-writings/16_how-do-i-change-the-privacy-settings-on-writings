# How do I change the privacy settings on one of my Writings?

When you create a Writing on FetLife the default privacy setting is set to ‘FetLifers’ - meaning everyone on FetLife will be able to view it!

You can change this before you post your Writing by selecting the ‘Friends-Only’ option from the menu. 

To change the privacy settings on a Writing after you have published it, simply go to the Writing you wish to change, select the three dots menu at the top right of the Writing and then select edit. A box will appear with a menu where you can select the option you prefer. Simply submit it to update your writing!
