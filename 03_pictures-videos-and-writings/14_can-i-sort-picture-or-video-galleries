# Can I sort Picture or Video galleries?

Why yes, yes you can!  

Simply head over to a gallery page (your own or someone else's) gallery and select the “Sort by:” drop-down link at the top right.  You'll see three choices; newest, oldest, and most loved.  Pick your favorite and enjoy!

Note: This sorting feature will not be saved.  You will need to change the sort pattern each time you return to the gallery.
