# Can I sort Picture or Video galleries?

You can sort a Picture or Video gallery (yours or someone else's) at any time by:

1. Visitng a gallery page
2. Selecting the “Sort by:” drop-down link at the top right. There are three choices; newest, oldest, and most loved.

_Note: This sorting will not be saved.  You will need to change the sort pattern each time you return to the gallery._
