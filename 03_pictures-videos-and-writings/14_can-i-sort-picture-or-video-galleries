# Can I sort Picture or Video galleries?

You can sort a Picture or Video gallery (yours or someone else's) at any time by:

1. Visitng a gallery page
2. Selecting the “Sort by:” drop-down link at the top right
3. Choosing "Newest", "Oldest", or "Most Loved"

_Note: This sorting will not be saved.  You will need to change the sort pattern each time you return to the gallery._
