# How do I delete my picture or video? 

You can delete a picture or video at anytime by:

1. Visiting the "Options" menu link located beneath the caption of the picture or video that you want to change
2. Selecting “Delete” to delete the picture or video.  (If the picture is currently your Avatar (profile picture), you will need to change your avatar to a different picture before you can delete it)
