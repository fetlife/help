# How do I upload a picture to FetLife via email?

Every member of FetLife is assigned a unique email address that can be used to email pictures directly into your gallery - it can even be used to upload multiple pictures at once! Neato! 

You can find your unique email address in the 'Email Pics To Profile' section of your [account settings](https://fetlife.com/settings/account)

How it works:
- Attach your pictures to an email and send it to your unique email address!
- The subject line that you write in your email will become the caption on the picture. 
- If you are uploading multiple pictures in one email they will all use the same subject line so their captions will also be the same.  
- There is a 25MB limit on email size. Depending on the size of your pictures, you should be able to send 5-10 pics in one email.

Special “rules” for the subject line of the email:
- In the subject line of the email, if you type "Private” before the words you want in your caption then the picture will be posted as friends only. 
- If you type "Avatar" in the subject line (and only send one picture) then that picture will be set as your main profile picture.
