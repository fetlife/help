# How do I upload a picture to FetLife via email?

Every member of FetLife is assigned a unique email address that can be used to email pictures directly into your gallery. This method allows you to upload multiple pictures at once.

You can email picture(s) to your gallery at any time by:

1. Attaching your picture(s) to an email and sending it to your unique email address
2. You can find your unique email address in the 'Email Pics To Profile' section here: https://fetlife.com/settings/account
2. The subject line that you write in your email will become the caption on the picture or pictures you upload 

Special "rules" for the subject line of the email:
- In the email's subject line, if you type "Private" before the caption, the picture will be posted as friends only. 
- If you type "Avatar" in the subject line (and only send one picture), the picture will be set as your main profile picture.

_Note: There is a 25MB limit on email size. Depending on your pictures' size, you should be able to send 5-10 pics in one email._
