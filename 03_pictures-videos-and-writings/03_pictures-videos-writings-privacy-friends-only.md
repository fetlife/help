# How do I edit the settings and privacy options or delete my picture or video? 

You can edit the settings and privacy options or delete a picture or video at anytime by:

1. Visiting the "Options" menu link located beneath the caption of the picture or video you want to change
2. Selecting “Edit” to update the caption, add or remove tags, or change your privacy options
3. Selecting “Set as Avatar” to make the picture your main profile picture
4. Selecting “Close Comments” to remove the option for people to comment on that picture or video (You can reopen comments in the same way)
5. Selecting “Delete” to delete the picture or video.  (If the picture is currently your Avatar (profile picture), you will need to change your avatar to a different picture before you can delete it)
