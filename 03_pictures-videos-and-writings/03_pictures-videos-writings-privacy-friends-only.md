# How do I delete or edit the settings and privacy options for my picture or video? 

Go to the picture or video you want to edit or delete.  Select the “Options” menu link (beneath the caption). 

Select “Edit” if you want to:
- Update the caption
- Add or remove tags
- Change your privacy options

Select “Set as Avatar” if you’d like to make the picture your main profile picture.

Select “Close Comments” to remove the option for people to comment on that picture. Reopening comments can be selected from the same menu when you’re ready to turn them back on!

Select “Delete” to delete your picture.  (If the picture is currently your Avatar (profile picture), you will need to change your avatar to a different picture before you can delete it.)

Nifty, eh? We say “eh” because we’re Canadian, and that's how we roll...
