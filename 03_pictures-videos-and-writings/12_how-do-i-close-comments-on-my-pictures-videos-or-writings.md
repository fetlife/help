# How do I close comment on my picture, video or writing?

You can disable or enable the ability for other people to leave comments on your pictures, videos or writings at any time by:

1. Opening the Picture, Video or Writing that you want to edit or delete
2. Selecting the menu in the upper right corner (which looks like three dots)
3. Selecting "Close Comments"
4. The page will refresh and close the comments.
5. To reopen comments go back to the menu in the upper right corner and select 'Re-open Comments'
